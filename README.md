# DRM IS NEVER AWESOME

## [Denuvo](https://irdeto.com/denuvo/)

### Pros of Denuvo

- None

## Cons of Denuvo

- Game will be unplayable in the future when the DRM server goes down, even if the game could easily work offline (example: Sonic Mania Plus)
- Excessive writing to the disk results in higher CPU usage (shortens battery life) and wears down your expensive solid state drive at a much faster rate
- Has kernel level access. If compromised, it can gain control of your entire computer
- Is classified as malware by multiple anti-viruses, due to its ring 0 CPU access
- Only works on Windows
- You are giving up your rights
- Is extremely easy to crack, several games have been cracked before release, and it is extremely common for the DRM to be cracked within hours of a new release
- Hurts game performance and makes the game much slower
- It is DRM
- It is proprietary, closed source software
- It is bad for the environment
- DRM is [defective by design](http://www.defectivebydesign.org/)

## [Google WideVine](https://www.widevine.com/solutions/widevine-drm)

### Pros of WideVine DRM

- None

### Cons of WideVine DRM

- Is owned by Google
- Is not secure, pointless, as it is constantly cracked
- Prevents you from accessing media with freedom
- Hurts small and medium size developers, as Google [refuses to certify most of them](https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/widevine/gmail-thread.html)
- Content will be unplayable in the future if contained inside the DRM
- You are giving up your rights
- It is DRM
- It is proprietary, closed source software
- It is bad for the environment
- DRM is [defective by design](http://www.defectivebydesign.org/)

## TL;DR

I don't support DRM, and neither should you.

**Extended TL;DR:**

This article is a list of DRM schemes and their problems. It is not advocating for the use of DRM whatsoever, in fact, it is advocating the exact opposite.

## [Denuvo](https://irdeto.com/denuvo/)

### Pros of Denuvo

- None

## Cons of Denuvo

- Game will be unplayable in the future when the DRM server goes down, even if the game could easily work offline (example: Sonic Mania Plus)
- Excessive writing to the disk results in higher CPU usage (shortens battery life) and wears down your expensive solid state drive at a much faster rate
- Has kernel level access. If compromised, it can gain control of your entire computer
- Is classified as malware by multiple anti-viruses, due to its ring 0 CPU access
- Only works on Windows
- You are giving up your rights
- Is extremely easy to crack, several games have been cracked before release, and it is extremely common for the DRM to be cracked within hours of a new release
- Hurts game performance and makes the game much slower

## Notable quotes about DRM

- If consumers even know there's a DRM, what it is, and how it works, we've already failed. - Peter Lee, Disney corporation
- The technology in question is an example of Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) -- technology designed to restrict the public. Describing it as "copyright protection" puts a favorable spin on a mechanism intended to deny the public the exercise of those rights which copyright law has not yet denied them. - Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU project (2006)
- The key issue here is that the protection scheme under Blu-ray is very anti-consumer and there's not much visibility of that. The inconvenience is that the movie studios got too much protection at the expense of consumers and it won't work well on PCs. You won't be able to play movies and do software in a flexible way. It's not the physical format that we have the issue with, it's that the protection scheme on Blu is very anti-consumer. - Bill Gates (2005)
- Digital files cannot be made uncopyable, any more than water can be made not wet. - Bruce Schneier (2001)
- DRM fails completely at preventing copying, but it is brilliant at preventing innovation - Cory Doctorow

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

No-one has asked any questions yet, so I will add one that I expect to be the most common:

### Why did you title this repository the way you did

Awesome lists are a thing on GitHub, but DRM is not awesome. An unawesome list doesn't have the same appeal, and I didn't want to just call it "list of DRM schmmes"
